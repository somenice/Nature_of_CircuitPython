# Nature_of_CircuitPython
A CircuitPython port of examples in The Nature of Code by Daniel Shiffman

For my examples I'm using two 64x32 pixel RGB displays chained to produce a 128x32 pixel "canvas".
The microcontroller driving the diplays is the Adafruit Matrix Portal M4.

In this exercise I'm converting select examples written for Javascript P5JS into Python for microcontrollers using the CircuitPython displayio Library.
